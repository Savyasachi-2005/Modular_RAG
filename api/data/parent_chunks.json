This method involves \npurposive or deliberate Selection of particular units of the Universe. \n\u2171) Simple random sampling this type of sampling is known as chance sampling or  probability \nsampling. In this case each & every item in the population has an equal Chance of being inclusion \nin the sample. \n e.g. If we have to select a sample  of 300 items from a universe of 15,000 items, we can put the \nnames or numbers for all 15,000 items on slips of paper and conduct a lottery. \n(iii) Systematic sampling: In",

Pareto diagrams : \nPareto diagrams are named after a 19th  century Italian economist and are used in quality management. \nTo illustrate the 80/20 rule, where 80% of quality improvements can come from addressing 20% of \nthe causes. In these diagrams, responses are sorted by importance, with bars arranged from tallest to \nshortest. Ex: Figure shows MindWriter customer complaints, highlighting that the top two issues \naccounted for 80% of perceptions of inadequate repair service. \n \nFigure:  Pareto Diagram of MindWriter Repair Complaints \n \n \nvi. Boxplots: \n Boxplots convey a detailed picture of the distribution\u2019s location, spread, shape, tail length, and \noutliers. They use the five -number summary that consists of the median, the upper and lower \nquartiles, and the largest and smallest obs",

These \ncomponents and their relationships are shown in Figure. \nOutliers, data points that exceed +1.5 the interquartile range, reflect unusual cases and are an \nimportant source of information for the study.

Mapping: \n Geographic Information System (GIS) software and coordinate measuring devices work by linking \ndata sets to each other with at least one common data field (e.g., a household\u2019s street address). The \nGIS allows the researcher to connect target and classification variables from a survey to specific \ngeographic-based databases like U.S. Census data, to develop a richer understanding of the \nsample\u2019s attitudes and behavior. The most common way to display such data is with a map. Colors \nand patterns denoting knowledge, attitude, behavior, or demographic dat",
